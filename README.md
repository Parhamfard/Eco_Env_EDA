# Economic and Environmental Indicators EDA Analysis of G20 Countries (1970-2020)

## Project Overview

This analyzes the relationships between key **economic** and **environmental** indicators for **G20 countries** over the time period from **1970 to 2020**. The four key indicators studied are:

- **Life Expectancy**
- **Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita**
- **CO2 Emissions per Capita**
- **Population**

The analysis focuses on the correlations between these indicators to explore how economic and environmental trends have evolved, and how they interact in the context of global development.

## Problem Statement

This analysis aims to explore:
1. The correlations between the four indicators across the **G20 countries**.
2. How these correlations have evolved from **1970 to 2020**, a period marked by significant global **economic** and **environmental** changes.

The **G20 countries** have a significant impact on the global economy, contributing around **85% of global trade**. Therefore, the analysis focuses on these nations, as they represent a disproportionate share of the world’s economic output and environmental footprint.

## Data Dictionary

| Indicator                      | Description                                             |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Life Expectancy**             | The average number of years a person is expected to live. |
| **Gross National Income (GNI)** | The total income earned by a country's residents, both domestically and internationally. |
| **CO2 Emissions per Capita**    | The amount of carbon dioxide emissions produced per person in a country. |
| **Population**                  | The total number of people living in each country. |

## Analysis Summary

The analysis explores the correlation patterns between the four indicators for the years **1970** and **2020**. The findings show:

1. **Life Expectancy and GNI**: There is a strong positive correlation between **Life Expectancy** and **GNI per Capita**, particularly in **1970 (0.81)**, which slightly decreases by **2020 (0.73)**.
2. **Life Expectancy and CO2 Emissions per Capita**: A strong positive correlation exists between **Life Expectancy** and **CO2 Emissions per Capita** in **1970 (0.72)**, which drops significantly to **0.42** by **2020**.
3. **CO2 Emissions per Capita and Population**: A negative correlation is observed between **CO2 Emissions per Capita** and **Population**, remaining consistent from **1970 (-0.29)** to **2020 (-0.28)**.
4. **CO2 Emissions per Capita and GNI per Capita**: In **1970**, the correlation between **CO2 Emissions per Capita** and **GNI per Capita** is **0.83**, but it decreases to **0.69** by **2020**.
5. **GNI per Capita and Population**: The negative correlation between **GNI per Capita** and **Population** slightly increases from **-0.31** in **1970** to **-0.34** in **2020**.

## Conclusions

### 1. **Correlations Between Indicators**
The analysis highlights the relationships between key indicators in G20 countries:
- **Life Expectancy and GNI per Capita**: A strong positive correlation was observed, though it weakened by 2020.
- **Life Expectancy and CO2 Emissions per Capita**: Positive but weaker by 2020, indicating progress in decoupling life expectancy from carbon emissions.
- **Life Expectancy and Population**: A weak negative correlation suggests that larger populations do not necessarily correlate with better health outcomes.
- **CO2 Emissions and Population**: A weak negative correlation suggests that population size doesn’t strongly affect emissions.

### 2. **Evolving Correlation Trends (1970-2020)**
- **Economic Growth and Life Expectancy**: Economic growth has lessened as a driver of life expectancy improvements, due to advancements in healthcare and technology.
- **CO2 Emissions and Economic Growth**: While historically linked, the correlation has weakened as cleaner technologies and environmental policies take effect.
- **Population and Life Expectancy**: Larger populations no longer hinder life expectancy as much, thanks to improvements in healthcare and urban planning.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis of correlations between **Life Expectancy**, **GNI per Capita**, **CO2 Emissions per Capita**, and **Population** in G20 countries, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Promote Green Economic Growth**: Invest in **renewable energy**, **clean manufacturing**, and **low-carbon innovations**.

2. **Improve Healthcare Access in Lower-GNI Countries**: Focus on **targeted healthcare**, strengthen **health infrastructure**, and support **international health funding**.

3. **Address Population Growth**: Implement **family planning**, invest in scalable healthcare, and educate on the link between **sustainable growth** and **health outcomes**.

4. **Monitor Demographic Changes**: Develop **policies** that balance growth with sustainable development and focus on **education**, **empowerment**, and **economic equity**.

In conclusion, prioritizing sustainable growth, equitable healthcare, and environmental responsibility will help G20 nations build a resilient future.

## Future Work

### 1. **Extend Analysis Beyond 2020**
Future research could expand the analysis to include the effects of **recent global events**, such as the **COVID-19 pandemic**, on life expectancy, economic growth, and emissions.

### 2. **Include Non-G20 Countries**
Expanding the analysis to **non-G20 countries**—especially emerging and low-income nations—could provide a broader understanding of global trends and challenges in balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability.

### 3. **Regional Analysis**
Focusing on specific regions, such as **Sub-Saharan Africa**, **South Asia**, or **Eastern Europe**, could identify regional trends and solutions that are more applicable to local contexts.

### 4. **Add More Indicators**
Future work could include additional indicators like **education**, **energy consumption**, **health expenditure**, and **air quality** to better understand the factors influencing sustainability and economic development.

### 5. **Advanced Forecasting Models**
Using **advanced statistical models** or **machine learning** to predict future trends could help policymakers make more informed decisions for sustainable development.

### 6. **Compare Developed vs Developing Nations**
A comparative analysis between **developed** and **developing countries** could help tailor strategies for sustainable development based on different economic contexts.
